Deployment

There are many ways to deploy a Django and React application. One popular option is to use Heroku. To deploy your application to Heroku, you will need to create a Heroku account and install the Heroku CLI. Once you have installed the Heroku CLI, you can deploy your application by running the following command:

heroku create django-react-todo-app

This will create a new Heroku application for you. Once the application has been created, you can deploy your code by running the following command:

git push heroku main

Once your code has been deployed, you can open your application in a web browser by navigating to the Heroku application URL.
